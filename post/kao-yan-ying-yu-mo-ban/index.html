推荐旅游 景点 +原因<br>
头脑风暴 The Great Wall The forbidden city<br>
吃喝 买纪念品</p>
<p>Dear Professor Cook,<br>
Welcome to Beijing! Having learned that you love traveling ,I am writing to recommend some place to you.<br>
First of all ,the forbidden city is a pretty good place for you because it is a masterpiece of Chinese architecture and has irreplaceable culture significance.Secondly,i suggest you pay a visit to Wangfujing Snack Street where you can find a large selection of traditional Chinese snacks and give yourself a treat .Besides , if you like to purchase some interesting souvenirs and handcrafts, Nanluoguxiang is a great choice.There are many shops with different styles.Th quality is much better than the street shops. It is opening till 10 pm,so it is also good to visit after a whole day of travel<br>
I hope my recommendations are of some help to you. If you have any questions or need,please feel free to contact me .</p>
