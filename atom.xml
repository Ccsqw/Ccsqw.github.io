头脑风暴 The Great Wall The forbidden city<br>
吃喝 买纪念品</p>
<p>Dear Professor Cook,<br>
Welcome to Beijing! Having learned that you love traveling ,I am writing to recommend some place to you.<br>
First of all ,the forbidden city is a pretty good place for you because it is a masterpiece of Chinese architecture and has irreplaceable culture significance.Secondly,i suggest you pay a visit to Wangfujing Snack Street where you can find a large selection of traditional Chinese snacks and give yourself a treat .Besides , if you like to purchase some interesting souvenirs and handcrafts, Nanluoguxiang is a great choice.There are many shops with different styles.Th quality is much better than the street shops. It is opening till 10 pm,so it is also good to visit after a whole day of travel<br>
I hope my recommendations are of some help to you. If you have any questions or need,please feel free to contact me .</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One reason Owlestone's device has generated such interest <strong>is that</strong> it has a documented record</p>
<p>Theories focusing on the role of society suggest that children commit crimes in response to their failure to rise above  their socioeconomic status ,or as  a rejection of middle-class values</p>
<p>in fact , instead of straining muscles to built them as exercise dose ,laughter apparently  accomplishes the opposite</p>
<p>it is a well -studied species ,and among the facts that have emerged  about it is that individual birds do ,indeed , have distict personanlites</p>
<p>But to the extent that unpredictability is part of how people understand themselves and part of what people like about themselves ,humanity is in the process of losing something significant<br>
.As they become more and more predictable ,the creature inhabiting the increasingly AI-mediated world will become less and less like us .</p>
<p>Containers may came loose in heavy whether and there is a chance of lighting knocking out communication.</p>
<p>They demonstrate that lighting strikes the Indian Ocean and the South China sea almost twice as often along shipping lanes as it does other areas of these waters .</p>
<p>As the map shows , those strikes that happened over the ocean were concentrated in places most plied by ships .In particular ,the shipping lane that passes from the south of Sri Lanka to the northern entrance of the straits of Malacca , and thence down the straits to Singapore,positively glows with lighting .(Its westward extension to the Suez canal was outside the study area .)So do the lanes from Singapore an the western part of Malaysia that head north-east across the South China Sea (倒装)</p>
<p>Neither changes in vertical wind shear nor differences in horizontal air movements seem likely to be causing this concentration of thunderstorms ,for other measurements suggest that these weather-modifying phenomena are the same inside shipping lanes as they are in neighbouring parts of the atmosphere immediately outside those lanes .Nor does it seem plausible that the ships themselves (admittedly made of metal ,and also the tallest structures on what is otherwise a flat surface )are responsible for attracting all the extra strikes involved .</p>
<p>The most likely explanation is particulate pollution emitted by ships using the shipping lanes</p>
<p>Typical marine clouds in unpolluted areas are composed of large droplets and do not rise to high altitude,but Dr Thornton and his team reckon that smaller droplets ,of sort that condense around oxides of sulphur,might more easily be carried upward by convection -forming,as they rose ,into towering storm clouds that would act as nurseries of lighting bolts</p>
